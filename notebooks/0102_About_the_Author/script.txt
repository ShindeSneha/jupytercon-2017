Hey everyone, and welcome to this course on natural language processing with spacy. Iâ€™m Aaron Kramer, your instructor. I wanted to take a minute to share some of my background with you. As a data scientist at DataScience Inc in Los Angeles, I help build tools and solutions to enable other data scientists to build and evaluate models, and their work throughout their organizations.

A lot of my work here has involved  processing natural language data, and building machine learning models thereon. For a lot of my nlp projects, Ive used spacy as part of pipeline, and I'm also a minor spacy contributor. Beyond natural language processing, my interests include Bayesian Inference, deep learning, econometrics, and model interpretability.

During my undergrad I studied economics at Swarthmore, with a focus on econometrics.

I also contribute to the Datascience blog, where you find my content pieces at this link, though we have a lot of amazing articles from other authors as well.

I'm looking forward to exploring natural language processing and the spacy library with you. Should you need to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me at aaron@datascience.com.
